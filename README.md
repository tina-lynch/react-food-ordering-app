# react-food-ordering-app

This is an excercise from a React Course that I'm currently doing on Udemy.

It was built as a code-along watching the tutorials, which has covered the following :
- custom hooks, useContext, useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef, useReducer
- network requests (api is fetching from a created Google Firebase data base, while also posting an 'order' to a different node in the database)
- form & input validations
- css modules
- fragments
- modals using react-dom
